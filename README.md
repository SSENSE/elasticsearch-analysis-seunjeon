# Elasticsearch analysis seunjeon

[seunjeon](https://bitbucket.org/eunjeon/seunjeon/src/master/elasticsearch/) is a plugin to user Korean morpheme anylyzer for Elasticsearch.

This repo does not add any new features to the seunjeon plugin itself. It is just a rebuild of the analyzer so that it is compatible with Elasticsearch version > 6.1.0.
